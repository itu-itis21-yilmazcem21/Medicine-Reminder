This project develops a simple, working Flutter (Dart) mobile application called Medicine Reminder that helps users take their medication on time and track adherence. The app targets
Android and iOS and focuses on core features: creating medicine schedules, local notifications for
timely reminders, snooze and mark-as-taken actions, adherence summaries, and basic persistence
on-device. The design emphasizes reliability, ease of use, and minimal configuration for patients
and caregivers. The implementation leverages Flutter for cross-platform UI, local notification
services for on-time alerts, and a lightweight local database for records. Evaluation will consider
reminder delivery accuracy, task completion rate, and user-perceived usability. The expected
outcome is a stable initial working release that improves day-to-day adherence through timely
reminders and simple tracking.
